It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total energy costs. A higher ratio indicates better energy efficiency, meaning the company generates more revenue per unit of energy cost. For instance, let us say we have two companies, A and B, each with the following figures for a given year:  \n\n- Company A:\n  - Revenue: 1,000,000\u20AC\n  - Energy Costs: 100,000\u20AC\n  - Energy-Revenue Cost Ratio: 1,000,000\u20AC / 100,000\u20AC = 10  \n\n- Company B:\n  - Revenue: 1,500,000\u20AC\n  - Energy Costs: 250,000\u20AC\n  - Energy-Revenue Cost Ratio: 1,500,000\u20AC / 250,000\u20AC = 6  \n\nIn this example, Company A has a higher Energy-Revenue cost ratio (10) compared to Company B (6), indicating that Company A is more efficient in generating revenue per unit of energy cost.
